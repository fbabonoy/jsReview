//  Variables & Datatypes

/*
A. Q +A
1. How do we assign a value to a variable?
let x = 20
2. How do we change the value of a variable?
x = 5
3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
let y = x
4. Remind me, what are declare , assign , and define ?
let declare =(assign) define
5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
sudo code is use so organise are thought in a way we can write latter
6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
think 80 program 20


B. Strings
For all other questions that involve writing code, you can solve them via the following instructions.
1. Create a variable called first Variable
let firstVariable
2. Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
firstVariable = "Hello World"
3. Change the value of this variable to some number
firstVariable = 5

4. Store the value of first Variable in a new variable called second Variable
let secondVariable = firstVariable
5. Change the value of secondVariable to any string.
secondVariable = "hi"
6. What is the value of firstVariable ?
5
7. Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my
name is " and the variable yourName so that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
ex: Hello, my name is Jean Valjean
*/

let name = "fernando Babonoyaba"
let expresion = `Hello, my name is ${name}`




// Boolean


const a = 4 ;
const b = 53 ;
const c = 57 ;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kevin';
console.log(a < b);
console.log( c > d );
console.log( 'Name' === 'Name');
// FOR THE NEXT TWO, USE ONLY && OR 11
console.log ( true !== false ) ;
console.log(false === false && false === false && false !== true);
console.log(false === false )
console.log(e === 'Kevin');
console.log(a < b < c ) ; // note: a < b < c i s NOT CORRECT Cand i s not a valid JS expressior
console.log( a === a)
console.log(48 == '48');


//d 
let animal = "cow"

if (animal === "cow") {
    console.log("mooooo");   
} else {
    console.log("Hey! You're not a cow.");
    
}
